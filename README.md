I took Machine Learning 2 with Prof Virgil Pavlu in my last semester at Northeastern. Throughout the semester we studied the intuition behind and implementation of various data processing techniques and machine learning models. This repo contains my implementation of these models for our homeworks.

HW01 - Decision Trees, Linear Regression
HW2 - Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent
HW03 - Perceptrons, Neural Networks
HW3b - GDA, Naive Bayes, EM
HW4a - Adaboost, Gradient Boosting
HW4b - Active Learning, ECOC
HW5 - Feature Analysis, PCA, Missing/Polluted features, HAAR
HW6 - SMO
HW7 - Kernels
